I make no guarantees to how useful they will be - but I found them useful so I am sharing them.

## JST XH

These have 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 pin JST XH headers.
Warning - these are made from the slightly iffy cheap versions at 2.54mm from Ali Express. Those will fit your breadboard and perf-board. However, genuine XH parts are 2.5mm - which will fit until you get to higher pin numbers. You have been warned.

These are breadboard only parts - I've not bothered with Schematic and PCB footprints for them as I've yet to need them. Feel free to make a PR fixing that.
